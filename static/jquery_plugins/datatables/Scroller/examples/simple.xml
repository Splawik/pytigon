<info><![CDATA[

Scroller is a plug-in for DataTables which enhances DataTables' built-in scrolling features to allow large amounts of data to be rendered on page very quickly. This is done by Scroller through the use of a virtual rendering technique that will render only the part of the table that is actually required for the current view.

Note that Scroller assumes that all rows are of the same height (in order to preform the required calculations. You can use `td { white-space: nowrap; }` in your CSS to ensure that text in rows does not wrap.

This example shows how Scroller for DataTables can be initialised by simply including the character `S` in sDom (note that the `S` must come after the `t` in sDom). Deferred rendering an and Ajax data source are also used in this example.
