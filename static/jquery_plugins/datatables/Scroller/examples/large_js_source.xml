<info><![CDATA[

This example is completely artificial in that the data generated is created on the client-side by just looping around a Javascript array and then passing that to DataTables. However, it does show quite nicely that DataTables and Scroller can cope with large amounts of data on the client-side quite nicely. Typically data such as this would be Ajax sourced and server-side processing should be considered.

Please be aware that the performance of this page will depend on your browser as the array of data is generated - for example IE6 will crawl!
